# Level Up
This app allows users to create and keep track of their quests - in real-life, video games, or table-top role-playing games - in order to organize and prioritize tasks efficiently.

## Next Steps
I'm far from mastering this skill and this entire project was so daunting to me, I had to place so many features and core functionalities into my project's icebox. When I have the time to revisit this app, I'd love to implement the following changes:
1. Filter feature.
2. Allowing the User to pick an avatar or upload a selfie.
3. Timestamps for comments.
4. Display Quest Creator on the Quest Log page.
5. Customized themes.
6. User Settings.
7. Notifications.
8. Friends List.
